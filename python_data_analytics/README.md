# Python Data Analytics Project

## Introduction

- Describe the business context of this project (please do not copy-paste text from the project kick-off ticket)
- Also, describe how LGS would use your analytic result (hint: see kick-off ticket)
- Describe your work and technologies used (e.g. Jupyter Notebook, Python libraries, data analytics, data warehouse, etc.)

In order to improve a business' operations, I was assigned to look into the company's transaction data and analyze their customers' shopping behaviour, and determine how the business can go about in their targeting marketing campaign. I used Python as my main language in analyzing the data. I also used Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, and SQLAlchemy. All my work was done in a Jupyter notebook, and the data was accessed either their given CSV file or Postgres database, which ultimately came from their data warehouse.

## Implementation

### Project Architecture

- Describe the architecture of this project, including the LGS web app.
- Draw an architecture Diagram (please do not copy-paste any diagram from the project board)

### Data Analytics and Wrangling

- Create a link that points to your Jupyter notebook (use the relative path `./retail_data_analytics_wrangling.ipynb`)
- Discuss how would you use the data to help LGS to increase their revenue (e.g. design a new marketing strategy with data you provided)

## Improvements

- List three improvements that you want to do if you got more time
