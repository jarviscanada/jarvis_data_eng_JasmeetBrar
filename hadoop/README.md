# Hadoop Project

## Introduction
- Purpose of this project (please see the project kick-off ticket)
- What you have learned or evaluated
- Talk about the Hadoop cluster, tools, and Hive project

The purpose of this project is to make use of Apache Hadoop to process big data given by an analytics team. Hadoop enabled me to make use of multiple machines to distribute the workload, and I was able to make use of Apache Hive, which allows me to execute SQL queries using the cluster.

## Hadoop Cluster
- cluster architecture diagram
    - 1 master and 2 workers nodes
    - HDFS, YARN, Zeppelin, Hive (hive Server, hive metastore, RDBMS), etc.
- Big data tools you evaluated (e.g. MapReduce, YARN, HDFS, Hive, Zeppelin, etc..)
- hardware specifications

## Hive Project
- Discuss how you optimized Hive queries? (e.g. partitions, columnar, etc..)
- Post your Zeppelin Notebook screenshot here
    - Make sure your Notebook is nice and clean as hiring managers will visit your project
    - use `Full Page Screen Capture` chrome extension to capture a webpage as a picture

## Improvements
- at least three improvements
