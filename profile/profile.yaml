# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I recently graduated from University of Toronto with an Honours Bachelor of Science (Computer Science Specialist and Math Minor), and I intend to venture into software development and data engineering. With my strong background in mathematics, it became natural that I am centered around problem-solving, and being able to construct elegant solutions to various problems. In terms of academics, I have studied operating systems, algorithms, computability, web development, parallel programming, scalable computing, machine learning, deep learning, and much more. I have experience in projects that involving compilers, web programming, scripting, and data visualization; and I have experience working as a software developer in helping a firm migrate its frontend services. Altogether, they make up all the skills and experience that I want to carry forward towards new opportunities. New opportunities that will make use of my skills and allow me to further learn new technologies. I am passionate about this journey that I'm on, and I can't wait to see what's up ahead.

    description: Implemented a monitoring agent that can track the hardware specifications and usage throughout time of host machines and store their data in a database. The monitoring agent is programmed using Bash, and Postgres is used as a database, which would run in a Docker container. Testing was all done on a CentOS 7 virtual machine running on the Google Platform. Every script was tested manually to ensure that they all adhere to their specifications.

    #URL is optional
    git_url: "https://github.com/Playjasb2/Simple-C-Compiler"
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: Architectured and designed a compiler in an ongoing project that can compile a simplified version of C to Assembly or x86_64. The source files are written in C++ and it uses CMake as a build system. CI/CD is done using GitHub Actions, and it is also used to automate testing done with CTest.
  - name: "Simple Toy Language Compiler"
    git_url: "https://github.com/Playjasb2/Toy-Language-Compiler"
    description: Worked in a team of four to develop a compiler that can compile a simple programming language into instructions that a VM can execute. The project was primarily done using Java and Apache Ant build system, while JFlex was used as a lexical analyzer, and Java CUP was used as a parser. Testing was automated using a Bash script that would run the compiler at various stages and check with our test cases.
  - name: "AWS r/Place Project"
    git_url: "https://github.com/Playjasb2/Place"
    description: Collaborated with my colleagues in a team to recreate an online canvas that would be deployed on AWS by implementing an architecture that is responsive and scalable. The server code was done using NodeJS, and Docker was used to containerize the application. AWS technologies such as ECS, Elasticache (Redis), and DynamoDB were used to ensure that it is scalable, data is replicated and is safe, and that the user experience is uncompromised.
