    description: Implemented a monitoring agent that can track the hardware specifications and usage throughout time of host machines and store their data in a database. The monitoring agent is programmed using Bash, and Postgres is used as a database, which would run in a Docker container. Testing was all done on a CentOS 7 virtual machine running on the Google Platform. Every script was tested manually to ensure that they all adhere to their specifications.

    description: Architectured and designed a compiler in an ongoing project that can compile a simplified version of C to Assembly or x86_64. The source files are written in C++ and it uses CMake as a build system. CI/CD is done using GitHub Actions, and it is also used to automate testing done with CTest.
  - name: "Simple Toy Language Compiler"
    git_url: "https://github.com/Playjasb2/Toy-Language-Compiler"
    description: Worked in a team of four to develop a compiler that can compile a simple programming language into instructions that a VM can execute. The project was primarily done using Java and Apache Ant build system, while JFlex was used as a lexical analyser, and Java CUP was used as a parser. Testing was automated using a Bash script that would run the compiler at various stages and check with our test cases.
