      "description": "Worked in a team of four to develop a compiler that can compile a simple programming language into instructions that a VM can execute. The project was primarily done using Java and Apache Ant build system, while JFlex was used as a lexical analyzer, and Java CUP was used as a parser. Testing was automated using a Bash script that would run the compiler at various stages and check with our test cases.",

The server code was done using NodeJS, and Docker was used to containerize the application. AWS technologies such as ECS, Elasticache (Redis), and DynamoDB were used to ensure that it is scalable, data is replicated and is safe, and that the user experience is uncompromised.",

  "summary": "I recently graduated from University of Toronto with an Honours Bachelor of Science (Computer Science Specialist and Math Minor), and I intend to venture into software development and data engineering. With my strong background in mathematics, it became natural that I am centered around problem-solving, and being able to construct elegant solutions that are extendable, scalable, and maintainable. In terms of academics, I have studied operating systems, algorithms, computability, web development, parallel programming, scalable computing, machine learning, deep learning, and much more. I have experience in projects involving compilers, web programming, scripting, and data visualization. As for work experience, I had worked as a software developer in helping a firm migrate its frontend services, and I currently work at Jarvis as a data engineer, where I work on projects that involve constructing some pipelines to deliver data in a format that would allow for further analysis. Altogether, they make up all the skills and experience that I want to carry forward towards new opportunities. New opportunities that will make use of my abilities and allow me to further learn new technologies. I am passionate about this journey that I'm on, and I can't wait to see what's up ahead."
